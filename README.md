# unit-4-game
### Overview
This project focuses on creating a simple attacked/defender Star Wars game using an interactive web page using JQuery, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

### Purpose
The project taught us how to use DOM element click event handlers to handle user interactions and how to dynamically manipulate DOM elements using JQuery.

### Game Description
The game is played by selecting a player/attacker from a list of Star Wars characters. The remaining characters become enemies available to defend against your player. You click on the Attack button to launch an attack on the current defender. The damage you inflict on the defender and the damage inflicted on you by the defender is displayed in the Fight Section underneath the defender's picture. The health points of your character and the defender (displayed below their corresponding oictures) are appropriately reduced by the amount of damage inflicted. When the defender's health points become less than or equal to zero, you will have defeated that defender and that defender will be removed from the game. You continue attacking selected defenders until no defenders remain. At this point, you win the game. If, however, your character's helth points become less than or equal to zero, you lose the game.
